# swagger-ui

*automatic_auth.js*: Automatically sets the authorization bearer so you don't have to do it yourself on each reload. Set the following parameters:
* <your_swagger_ui_url>: The url (or regex) to your swagger-ui
* AUTH_VALUE: The auth you want to set, e.g. an api_key or a JWT
* AUTH_INDEX: The index of the form in the auth dialog box. 0 is the top most form, 1 the next and so on
