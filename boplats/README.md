=======

A set of tampermonkey scripts to ease the visualization of data at http://nya.boplats.se  
NOTE: All scripts use swedish as default language.

*QueuePosition.js*: Shows the number of people that are ahead of you in the queue for an apartment. The number is color coded; green indicates that you have a chance of getting the apartment, orange/yellow indicates that there is a very samll chance, and red indicates that there is no chance. The script is used on https://nya.boplats.se/minsida/ansokta  

*ReadAllMessages.js*: Since reading a lot of inbox messages is an extremely tedious task, this script adds a button to read all unread messages. The script is used on https://nya.boplats.se/minsida/meddelande  

*SortPastApartments.js*: Sorts past apartments based on the number of days required to obtain an apartment, either in ASC or DESC. Can be used to see which areas that are easy or hard to get an apartment in. The script is used on https://nya.boplats.se/minsida/ansokta/past/1hand
