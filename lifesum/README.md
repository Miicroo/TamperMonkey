# lifesum
Lifesum tampermonkey scripts.

Currently only one working script:  

*getNutritionData.js* When logged in, the script adds two input boxes with dates in them. Adjust dates to whatever date range you would like and click the download button. The script will retrieve all nutrition data from lifesum between the dates (both start and end date are inclusive), and when all data is parsed a JSON file will automatically be downloaded.
